# Python and Machine Learning

These are notes from the Python bootcamp (with focus on ML) I taught in the 2023 summer. These notes are public and can be used by anyone (as long as its non-commercial use).

All these notes are in JuPyter notebook format and hence can be directly run locally. 

## Overview

- **[Python Language](/Python%20Language)**: This folder contains Python related notes (**Basics**, **OOP**, **NumPy**, **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**).
- **[Deep Learning Theory](/DL%20Theory)**: Just a little bit on DL theory. I have some notes on Microsoft OneNote and will import them too, soon.
- **[DL Libraries](/DL%20Libraries)**: Some coverage of **JAX**, **PyTorch**, Keras and Hugging Face.
- **[NLP](/NLP)**: Added recently (in summer 2024) and will be expanded further. 
- **[Mathematical Background](/Mathematical%20Background)**: Couldn't focus much on it. But I will add more notebooks there soon.

### Plans for v2.0

By November, 2024, I am expecting to add: 

- A couple of blogs on **Vector databases**.
- A couple of blogs on some API examples.
- A blog on Web Scraping.
